# Debezium Multi-Source Implementation

## Implementation Summary

I've implemented a comprehensive solution for using Debezium with multiple source databases:

1. **Source Database Support**:
   - MySQL (already supported)
   - PostgreSQL (added)
   - MongoDB (added)
   - Oracle (added)
   - Cassandra (added)

2. **Configuration System**:
   - Created a flexible environment configuration in `.env.new`
   - Added feature flags to enable/disable sources
   - Implemented dynamic connector selection based on SOURCE_TYPE

3. **Docker Compose**:
   - Added profiles for conditional service startup
   - Configured all source databases with appropriate settings
   - Added support for switching between sources

4. **Data Generator**:
   - Enhanced to support all source databases
   - Shared data structure (customers/orders) across all sources
   - Configuration via environment variables

5. **Debezium Server**:
   - Dynamic configuration via debezium-start.sh script
   - Support for all source connectors
   - Consistent event routing to RabbitMQ

6. **Testing Scripts**:
   - Updated run.sh with source selection options
   - Enhanced test_stack.sh for multi-source testing
   - Improved test_rabbitmq.sh for message flow testing

7. **Documentation**:
   - Updated CONFIG_UPDATE.md with new configuration details
   - Added usage instructions for all sources

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select a source database**:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --mysql              # Use MySQL as source
   ./run.sh --postgresql         # Use PostgreSQL as source
   ./run.sh --mongodb            # Use MongoDB as source
   ./run.sh --oracle             # Use Oracle as source
   ./run.sh --cassandra          # Use Cassandra as source
   ./run.sh --all --clean        # Set up all sources (clean data first)
   ```

2. **Test the stack**:
   ```bash
   ./test_stack.sh               # Test the entire stack
   ./test_rabbitmq.sh            # Test RabbitMQ specifically
   ```

3. **Monitor the CDC process**:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f debezium        # Watch Debezium logs
   docker compose logs -f go-consumer     # Watch Go consumer logs
   ```

4. **Check data in MongoDB sinks**:
   ```bash
   # Replace {source} with mysql, postgresql, mongodb, oracle, or cassandra
   docker exec -it mongodb1 mongosh -u admin -p admin \
     --eval 'use cdc_data; db.{source}_customers.find()'
   ```

## Notes on Implementation

1. **No Kafka**: As requested, the implementation doesn't use Kafka at any point. Debezium Server connects directly to RabbitMQ as a sink.

2. **Configurability**: The entire stack can be configured via environment variables and command-line options.

3. **Source Limitations**: Debezium can only use one source type at a time, but the infrastructure supports all source types.

4. **Data Generator**: Supports all source databases with a unified data model.

5. **MongoDB Sinks**: Data is stored in collections named by source and table (e.g., mysql_customers, postgresql_orders).

Enjoy your multi-source CDC setup!
